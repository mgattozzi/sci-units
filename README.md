This was an example library used to show how one might enforce type safety to
help avoid logic bugs in Rust. Rust guarantees memory safety, but it doesn't
prevent logic bugs. However, with Rust's strong and flexible type system we can
use it to enforce certain rules and avoid implementations that are more prone
to incorrect usage.
